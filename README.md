### Usage

Upon entering the app you will see the dashboard where you can view users posts. We can also see the amount of upvotes and read comments from other users!

If there is a new user they will need to login in order to create, comment, and upvote any posts which they can do by clicking the login button.

Once the user has either signed up or logged in, they will be redirected to their personal dashboard. Here the user can see the posts they have created.

Users can then click the edit button after creating a post to update or delete a post. Users will also now have the ability to upvote posts.
